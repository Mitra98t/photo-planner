Photo planner is a web app that helps you plan your photography trips. It allows you to search for locations and get weather information.

The photos you see can be filtered based on wheather, time of day and season. This helps you plan your trip and get the best photos.

All the photos are uploaded with users, and the metadata (exif data) are visible. This can also help you learn from other photographers.

The app works well on all kind of devices, including mobile phones.
